README

This is my repository of dotfiles. Currently, I have following files in
repository. There is no plan to put my password/login details ;)

Please send your patch(es) to them!

* bashrc (~/.bashrc)
* quiltrc (~/.quiltrc)
* sources.list.home (/etc/apt/sources.list)
* sources.list.work (/etc/apt/sources.list)
* vimrc (~/.vimrc)
* xorg.conf.home (/etc/X11/xorg.conf)
* xorg.conf.work (/etc/X11/xorg.conf)

This is not dotfiles but I found that having separate software for books and
movies collection is bad idea so, here it is!

* books.txt
* movies.txt
